# Hi there 👋
### I'm a senior computer science student, my current learning path and projects are focused on **Data science and AI**.

- 🔭 Currently, I work with my colleagues in our graduation project to explore new deep learning model architecture to predict heart arrhythmia’s diseases from cardiac ECG Signals.

# Recent Work:
## [Winning Move Prediction in Connect 4 Game Using Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/RaghadTheScientist/Connect4_ML_Project)
- This project aims to develop and evaluate several machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the next best move in connect 4 game.
My role focused on developing CNN model capable of capturing strategic and positional patterns. The CNN model was built using the PyTorch framework, and was experimented with through several model architectures and training strategies.

## Classifying Math Problems (NLP) –
- A Kaggle Competition - Ranked 83/338
- Trained an NLP DebertaV2 classification model to categorize math problems.
- Cleaned noisy LaTeX-rich text using normalization, lemmatization, and artifact removal.
- Gained experience in NLP preprocessing and fine-tuning transformer models.

## [Alzheimer’s disease prediction from MRI brain scans](https://github.com/LayanAlrashoud/Alzheimer-s-disease-Misk-Samsung)
This project is to design and implement a deep learning-based classification system that analyzes brain images to distinguish between different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 

## Content-Aware Image Size Reduction
- As team project, We Developed an image resizing application that keeps the most important features in the image while reducing the dimensions, using the Seam Carving technique.
- Implemented and compared Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy approaches, By analyzing and evaluating time/space complexity for each method.
- Created pseudo-code and functional Python implementations.
- Applied core image processing techniques, including energy map computation.
